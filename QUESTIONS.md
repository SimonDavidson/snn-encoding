# Open questions for the design session

Raised by the implementation session (or by Simon) when something needs a
decision that isn't in DECISIONS.md or the specs. Simon carries these to the
design session; answers come back as edits here plus a DECISIONS.md entry.

### Q01 — placeholder
**Raised:** 2026-08-20 by design session
**Context:** repository scaffold created
**Question:** none yet; this file is a channel, not a backlog.
**Blocking?** no
**Answer:** n/a

### Q03 — cutoff for the rectify-lowpass envelope of equation (9)
**Raised:** 2026-09-02 by implementation session
**Context:** implementing `Filterbank.envelope`. F4 exercises the `"hilbert"`
branch only, so nothing in the known-answer suite constrains equation (9). The
branch would have shipped looking correct while returning mostly carrier.
**Question:** equation (9) is written `e_c = LPF_fcut(max(x_c, 0))` — a single
cutoff for the whole bank. What should `f_cut` be, and should it stay a single
value or become channel-relative?
**Measured:** correlation between the extracted envelope and a known 5 Hz
modulator, by channel centre frequency, for a 1 s AM tone (Hilbert shown for
reference):

| f_c (Hz) | hilbert | 1 kHz, order 2 | 300 Hz, order 2 | 300 Hz, order 4 | f_c/4, order 4 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 196 | 0.910 | 0.237 | 0.268 | 0.253 | 0.769 |
| 479 | 0.967 | 0.270 | 0.607 | 0.853 | 0.934 |
| 953 | 0.988 | 0.366 | 0.936 | 0.980 | 0.978 |
| 3057 | 0.999 | 0.961 | 0.997 | 0.995 | 0.997 |

**Options considered:**
1. Single fixed cutoff, 300 Hz, 4th order — faithful to equation (9) as
   written; good above ~500 Hz, poor in the low channels. *Implemented as the
   provisional default.*
2. Channel-relative cutoff, `min(f_cut, f_c/4)`, 4th order — uniformly better,
   but departs from equation (9), which specifies one cutoff.
3. Declare equation (9) unusable below some f_c and restrict it to a
   high-frequency subset of the bank.
4. Accept the low-channel carrier leakage as physiologically real — auditory
   nerve fibres genuinely phase-lock below ~1 kHz — and treat equation (9) as
   a deliberately different representation rather than a cheaper equation (8).

**Blocking?** no — `"hilbert"` is the SPEC section 3 default and every current
test path uses it. It blocks only the envelope-method sweep.
**Answer:** (design session)
